/*
  BUG #3 — Props Not Updating

  This component displays a message based on a prop and includes
  a button that should change that message.

  Right now, the message is being stored in a way that React does not track,
  so the UI does not update when the value changes.

  Use the commented "Explanation" section at the bottom of this lesson's components.

import { useState } from 'react';

export default function BugProps({ name = 'friend' }) {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('Hello, ' + name);

  function handleChange() {
    setMessage('Hi, ' + name + '!');
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{message}</p>
      <button onClick={handleChange}>Change Greeting</button>
    </div>
  );
}

// Explanation:
// Before the "message" variable was regular JavaScript variable, not React state.
// And React didn't have any idea it was changed.
// After useState hook usage react knows and re-render component
// And "handleChange" function before just updated "message" variable, but now it's React state
// Now it update React state using "setMessage" function.
